# SwiftArrayParse
Summing any two unique member integers that equal entered numeral.
This project started out with a simple proof-of-concept demo for Microsoft using Objective-C.
I wasn't happy with it, being that I didn't have time so I worked on it at home over the weekend; this time using Swift 2.2.

The request was to create code that can add any two numbers of an array that equals a particular number.
I've enhanced that to include ALL pair of UNIQUE numbers with garbage-entry filtration.

Thus, enter any amount of numbers (with comma delimiters) and this application will remove duplicates and instantly display all pairs of number that sum to the target sum.

Language: Swift 2.2 via Xcode 7.3
